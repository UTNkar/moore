# Front-end for Project Moore (UTN Modules)

At the time of writing, the front-end of Project Moore is made up of HTML-templates. This application intends to replace that. The idea is to expose isolated modules that can be embeddable for use on e.g. Webflow.

It is pre-rendered and hosted at [modules.utn.se](https://modules.utn.se).

## Modules

The following are the modules to be implemented for now, using the other parts of the Moore codebase as the API for the functionality and data fetching.

### Membership Check

Allows for checking if a user is a member of UTN by providing a SSN.

### Events

Forms and information for events, such as applications, tickets, etc.

### Involvement

Forms and information for available roles.
